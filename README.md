# Retail markdown optimizer

This project focuses on building a high-fidelity demand forecasting engine for large-scale retail inventory management. Moving beyond standard time-series models, this repository documents the journey of creating a "Digital Twin" of retail demand across 10 different stores, specifically optimizing for "Elite" (high-volume) products.
